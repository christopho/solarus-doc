/**
\page quest_fonts Fonts

The \c fonts directory contains the font files used by the engine and your
quest.
Solarus supports both outline fonts and bitmap fonts.

Like maps, musics, languages, etc., fonts are a resource declared in the
\ref quest_database_file "quest database file".

\section quest_fonts_outline Outline fonts

Outline fonts (or vector fonts) are the fonts you commonly use in a word
processor. They are composed of vector lines and curves,
and can be scaled to any size without pixellation.

In Solarus, the formats of outline fonts supported are the ones of the
SDL_ttf library, including \c .ttf, \c .tcc and \c fon.
At runtime, you can set their size and their color
(see the
\ref lua_api_text_surface "text surface API").

\section quest_fonts_bitmap Bitmap fonts

Sometimes, you don't want scalable
fonts, but you want to define your font pixel by pixel.
This is especially true for old-school looking games
when you want small letters.

A bitmap font is a font whose letters directly come from a PNG image file.
With a bitmap font, you cannot change the size or the color.
But you can for example add a border to your letters,
which is impossible with outline fonts.

In Solarus, a bitmap font is a single PNG image that contains characters
organized in the following specific way.

All characters in the image have the same size (for example 8x12 pixels).
The characters in the image must be organized in 16 rows and 128 columns.
It is like a big table of characters. The size of a single character is
implicit: the engine determines it by dividing the height of your image by
16 and the width by 128.

Characters are organized in the UTF-8 order.
The first row of the image corresponds to the 128 characters that are encoded
in a single byte in UTF-8. This is exactly the ASCII table.
If you only need ASCII characters, you can leave the rest of your image entirely
transparent.
The other 15 rows allow you to put any character that can be encoded in two
bytes in UTF-8.
In UTF-8, characters that use two bytes have the form
<tt>110xxxxx 10xxxxxx</tt>. If you remove the fixed \c 110 in the first byte
and the fixed \c 10 in the second byte, you obtain a 11-bit number, in other
words, a number between 128 and 2047 (the Unicode code point of the character).
This code point gives you the
index of the rectangle of your character in the image.

All data files that include text are encoded in UTF-8 in Solarus.
Therefore, unless you have characters that need more than two bytes in
UTF-8, you can draw your text with a PNG font.
