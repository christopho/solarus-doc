\page lua_api_path_finding_movement Path finding movement

\tableofcontents

A path finding movement is a particular
\ref lua_api_path_movement "path movement" where
the path is calculated to reach a target.
The target is a \ref lua_api_entity "map entity"
(by default the \ref lua_api_hero "hero"). The movement calculates
repeatedly the shortest path towards the target entity, taking into account
obstacles of the \ref lua_api_map "map".
With this type of movement, an entity is capable of finding its way in a maze.

\remark This type of movement computes a precise path on the map grid and
avoids complex obstacles by using a sophisticated A.I. algorithm
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*">A*</a>).
If you just need to go straight towards a target,
which may be more natural for basic enemies,
see the \ref lua_api_target_movement "target movement" type.

\section lua_api_path_finding_movement_inherited_methods Methods inherited from movement

Path finding movements are particular \ref lua_api_movement "movement" objects.
Therefore, they inherit all methods from the type movement.

See \ref lua_api_movement_methods to know these methods.

\section lua_api_path_finding_movement_methods Methods of the type path finding movement

The following methods are specific to path finding movements.

\subsection lua_api_path_finding_movement_set_target path_finding_movement:set_target(entity)

Sets the target entity of this movement.
- \c entity (\ref lua_api_entity "entity"): The entity to target.

\subsection lua_api_path_finding_movement_get_speed path_finding_movement:get_speed()

Returns the speed of this movement.
- Return value (number): The speed in pixels per second.

\subsection lua_api_path_finding_movement_set_speed path_finding_movement:set_speed(speed)

Sets the speed of this movement.
- \c speed (number): The new speed in pixels per second.

\subsection lua_api_path_finding_movement_get_angle path_finding_movement:get_angle()

Returns the angle of the current trajectory in radians.

East is <tt>0</tt>,
North is <tt>math.pi / 2</tt>,
West is <tt>math.pi</tt>,
South is  <tt>3 * math.pi / 2</tt>.
- Return value (number): The angle in radians.

\remark If you prefer a value in a 4-direction system, see
\ref lua_api_movement_get_direction4 "movement:get_direction4()".

\section lua_api_path_finding_movement_inherited_events Events inherited from movement

Path finding movements are particular \ref lua_api_movement "movement" objects.
Therefore, they inherit all events from the type movement.

See \ref lua_api_movement_events to know these events.
