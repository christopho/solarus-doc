\page quest Solarus 1.6 - Quest data files specification

We explain here how a quest is built.

A quest is a data package that may be run by the Solarus C++ engine
(either by the \c solarus-run executable
or by the Solarus GUI).

When you run the \c solarus-run executable file, it needs the path of the quest
to launch.
This can be done at runtime by specifying the path as a command-line argument:
<tt>solarus-run path/to/your/quest</tt>.
If the quest path is not specified, the current directory is considered by
default, unless you compiled Solarus with another default quest path.

When you run the Solarus GUI (the \c solarus executable file),
you can select graphically the quest to run
and you can change some settings.

In both cases, the quest may have one of the following two forms:
- A zip archive called \c data.solarus or \c data.solarus.zip
  and containing all data of your quest.
  This archive form is useful when your quest is finished and you distribute it
  to people.
- A directory called \c data and containing all data of your quest.
  This form is handy when you are developing your quest. It is also the only
  possible form to edit your quest with Solarus Quest Editor.
  In fact, when you modify a map in the editor, you don't even need to restart
  the game.

The data files represent all resources used by both the engine and the quest,
such as sounds, musics, images, sprites, dialogs, maps and Lua scripts.
We specify here the details for all those files.

Here is the full structure of the \c data directory / \c data.solarus archive
/ \c data.solarus.zip archive
of a quest and the syntax of each file.
