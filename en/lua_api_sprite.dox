\tableofcontents

A sprite is an animated image.
It is managed by an animation set. The animation set defines
which animations are available and describes, for each animation,
a sequence of images in each direction.

A sprite has the following properties:
- a current animation from its animation set (like \c "walking" or \c "hurt"),
- a current direction that indicates where the sprite is facing,
- a current frame: the index of the current individual image in the sequence.

The animation set of a sprite is composed of one or several PNG images that
store all the frames, and a data file that describes how frames are
organized in the PNG images. The data file also indicates the delay to make
between frames when animating them and other properties like whether the
animation should loop.
See the \ref quest_sprite_data_file "sprites syntax"
for more information about the format of sprites.

We describe here the Lua API that you can use to show sprites during your
game or your menus.

\section lua_api_sprite_functions Functions of sol.sprite

\subsection lua_api_sprite_create sol.sprite.create(animation_set_id)

Creates a sprite.
- \c animation_set_id (string): Name of the animation set to use. This name
  must correspond to a valid sprite sheet data file in the \c sprites directory
  (without its extension).
- Return value (sprite): The sprite created, or \c nil if the sprite data file
  could not be loaded.

\section lua_api_sprite_inherited_methods Methods inherited from drawable

Sprites are particular \ref lua_api_drawable "drawable" objects.
Therefore, they inherit all methods from the type drawable.

See \ref lua_api_drawable_methods to know these methods.

\section lua_api_sprite_methods Methods of the type sprite

The following methods are specific to sprites.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_get_animation_set sprite:get_animation_set()

Returns the name of the animation set used by this sprite.
- Return value (string): Name of the animation set used by this sprite.
  This name corresponds to a sprite sheet data file in the \c sprites directory
  (without its extension).

\subsection lua_api_sprite_get_animation sprite:get_animation()

Returns the name of the current animation of this sprite.
- Return value (string): Name of the current animation.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_set_animation sprite:set_animation(animation_name, [next_action])

Sets the current animation of this sprite.
- \c animation_name (string): Name of the animation to set.
  This animation must exist in the animation set.
- \c next_action (function or string, optional): What to do when the animation
  finishes.
  This parameter only has an effect if the animation finishes, that is, if it
  does not loop.
  If you pass a function, this function will be called when the animation
  finishes.
  If you pass a string, this should be the name of an animation of the sprite,
  and this animation will automatically be played next.
  No value means no action after the animation finishes: in this case, the
  sprite stops being displayed.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_has_animation sprite:has_animation(animation_name)

Returns whether the specified animation exists on a sprite.
- \c animation_name (string): Name of the animation to check.

  animation with this name.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_get_frame_delay sprite:get_frame_delay([animation_name])

Returns the delay between two frames of this sprite in an animation.

by \ref lua_api_sprite_set_frame_delay "set_frame_delay()".

  This animation must exist in the animation set.
  No value means the current animation.
- Return value (number): The delay in milliseconds between two frames in
  the current animation. \c nil means infinite and
  it is only allowed for single-frame animations.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_set_frame_delay sprite:set_frame_delay(delay)

Changes the delay between two frames of this sprite in the current animation.

Use this function if you want to override the normal delay
(the one defined in the sprite data file).
- \c delay (number): The new delay in milliseconds. \c nil means infinite
  and is only allowed for single-frame animations.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_get_size sprite:get_size([animation_name, direction])

Returns the frame size of this sprite in an animation and direction.
- \c animation_name (string, optional): Name of an animation of the sprite.
  This animation must exist in the animation set.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_get_origin sprite:get_origin([animation_name, direction])

Returns the coordinates of the origin point of this sprite in an 
animation and direction, relative to the upper left corner of a frame.

The origin is the point of synchronization for sprites that have several
animations or directions of different sizes,
and for entity sprites that are larger than the entity itself.

See \ref lua_api_entity_get_origin "entity:get_origin()" for more details.

In a given animation and direction of a sprite,
the origin point is the same for all frames.

- \c animation_name (string, optional): Name of an animation of the sprite.
  This animation must exist in the animation set.
  No value means the current animation.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_set_paused sprite:set_paused([paused])

Pauses or resumes the animation of this sprite.
- \c paused (boolean, optional): \c true to pause the sprite,
  \c false to unpause it. No value means \c true.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_set_ignore_suspend sprite:set_ignore_suspend([ignore])

During a game, sets whether the animation should continue even when the map is
suspended.
- \c ignore (boolean, optional): \c true to continue animation even when the map is
  suspended, \c false otherwise. No value means \c true.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_synchronize sprite:synchronize([reference_sprite])

Synchronizes the frames of this sprite with the frames of a reference sprite.
The synchronization will be performed whenever both animation names match.
The current sprite will no longer apply its normal frame delay: instead, it
will now always set its current frame to the current frame of its reference
sprite.
- \c reference_sprite (sprite, optional): The reference sprite. \c nil means
  stopping any previous synchronization.

\section lua_api_sprite_events Events of the type sprite

them.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_on_animation_changed sprite:on_animation_changed(animation)

Called whenever the animation of this sprite has changed.
- \c animation (string): Name of the new animation.

\subsection lua_api_sprite_on_direction_changed sprite:on_direction_changed(animation, direction)

- \c animation (string): Name of the current animation.
- \c direction (number): The new current direction (the first one is \c 0).

\subsection lua_api_sprite_on_frame_changed sprite:on_frame_changed(animation, frame)
