/**
\page lua_api_random_path_movement Random path movement

\tableofcontents

The random path movement is a particular case of
\ref lua_api_path_movement "path movement",
where the path is chosen automatically.
The resulting movement is composed of repeated random steps
in the four main directions only and with a length that is a multiple of
8 pixels.

\remark This movement is a typical random walk movement.
You will probably use it for \ref lua_api_npc "NPCs".

Example of use:
\verbatim
-- Example of code from a map script.
-- Assume that there is an NPC called "bob" on this map.
function sol.map:on_started()
  -- The map has just started: make bob walk.
  bob:start_movement(sol.movement.create("random_path"))
end
\endverbatim

\section lua_api_random_path_movement_inherited_methods Methods inherited from movement

Random path movements are particular \ref lua_api_movement "movement" objects.
Therefore, they inherit all methods from the type movement.

See \ref lua_api_movement_methods to know these methods.

\section lua_api_random_path_movement_methods Methods of the type random path movement

The following methods are specific to random path movements.

\subsection lua_api_random_path_movement_get_speed random_path_movement:get_speed()

Returns the speed of this movement.
- Return value (number): The speed in pixels per second.

\subsection lua_api_random_path_movement_set_speed random_path_movement:set_speed(speed)

Sets the speed of this movement.
- \c speed (number): The new speed in pixels per second.

\subsection lua_api_random_path_movement_get_angle random_path_movement:get_angle()

Returns the angle of the current trajectory in radians.

East is <tt>0</tt>,
North is <tt>math.pi / 2</tt>,
West is <tt>math.pi</tt>,
South is  <tt>3 * math.pi / 2</tt>.
- Return value (number): The angle in radians.

\remark If you prefer a value in a 4-direction system, see
\ref lua_api_movement_get_direction4 "movement:get_direction4()".

\section lua_api_random_path_movement_inherited_events Events inherited from movement

Random path movements are particular \ref lua_api_movement "movement" objects.
Therefore, they inherit all events from the type movement.

See \ref lua_api_movement_events to know these events.
